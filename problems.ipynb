By converting both the combination and the selected cups into sets, we can use the intersection to find which cups overlap. The length of this overlap is recorded in `no_overlaps`, giving the number of correct matches for each combination and showing how many cups would be correctly identified by chance."

    "\n",
    "- The mean sample SD (0.973) is slightly higher than the mean population SD (0.923) due to Bessel’s correction, which inflates the SD to provide an unbiased estimate. \n",
    "- This difference (~0.05) is most noticeable for small sample sizes because the sample standard deviation divides by `𝑛 − 1` rather than `𝑛` slightly inflating the estimate.\n",
    "- As the sample size increases, this correction becomes less significant, and we expect the sample standard deviation to converge toward the population standard deviation\n",
