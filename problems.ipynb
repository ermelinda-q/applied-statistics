    "Let's extend the Lady Tasting Tea experiment as follows. The original experiment has 8 cups: 4 tea-first and 4 milk-first. Suppose we prepare 12 cups: 8 tea-first and 4 milk-first. A participant claims they can tell which was poured first.\n",

    "In your notebook, explain your simulation process clearly, report and interpret the estimated probability, and discuss whether, based on this probability, you would consider extending or relaxing the p-value threshold compared to the original design"
