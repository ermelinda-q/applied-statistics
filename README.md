## About this Repository

This Git repository includes all the materials for the Applied Statistics module, part of my [Higher Diploma in Computer Science in Data Analytics](https://www.gmit.ie/higher-diploma-in-science-in-computing-in-data-analytics#:~:text=You%20are%20a%20Level%208,topics%20in%20your%20original%20degree.) at [ATU](https://www.gmit.ie/).

## Repository Structure

```
applied-statistics/
│-- .gitignore          # Specifies files and directories to be ignored by Git
│-- README.md           # Project documentation (this file)

```

## Assessment Purpose

This assessment demonstrates the achievement of the learning outcomes for this module. It involves completing a series of problems within a single Jupyter Notebook, hosted in a GitHub repository created specifically for this assessment.

The work describes the stochastic nature of real-world measurements, sources relevant documentation to programmatically perform statistical tests, selects appropriate statistical tests to investigate given claims, and applies those tests to real data sets with clear interpretation of results.
